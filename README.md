Hey, Spatiocorne here !
Wanna know a bit more about me ?
I'm a junior developer who have started his development journey with some basis of HTML/CSS/JS before switching to python for creating funny and entertaining projects for myself.
Currently my code is mostly in C because of my on going cursus in 42 School.
